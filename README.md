FetchError.js
=============
[![NPM version][npm-badge]](https://www.npmjs.com/package/fetch-error)

FetchError.js is an error class for use with the [Fetch API][fetch].  
It's based on [StandardHttpError.js][standard-http-error].

Installing
----------
```sh
npm install fetch-error
```

FetchError.js follows [semantic versioning](http://semver.org), so feel free to depend on its major version with something like `>= 1.0.0 < 2` (a.k.aÂ `^1.0.0`).


Using
-----
```javascript
var FetchError = require("fetch-error")

function errorify(res) {
  if (res.status >= 400 && res.status < 600)
    throw new FetchError(res.status, res.statusText, {response: res})
  else
    return res
}

var res = fetch("/").then(errorify)
```

Should the response be unsuccessful, the promise will be rejected with `FetchError` Such a pattern of separating success flows from failures is very handy: in the response resolve handlers you know all went well and don't have to double check for errors every time.

You can also later detect an erroneous response from other errors, such as bugs, through `instanceof`:

```javascript
res.catch(function(err) {
  if (err instanceof FetchError) console.error(err.message)
  else throw err
})
```

For a library that does the above and slightly more, see [FetchThrow.js][fetch-throw].
